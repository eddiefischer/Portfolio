    <h1>Drawing Performance</h1>
    <div class="text"> 
     The goal of this project was to represent motion in architectural forms. We began with an
assigned tool which we constructed several
drawings of. The first set of drawings was static, and the second in motion. As the project
progressed, we thought more about the qualities of motion associated with the use of the tool. Finally, with a partner we built a sculptural wood model that reflected the motion of each of our tools. During this project my partner, Grace Ji, and I began by thinking somewhat literally, and gradually began to abstract our ideas more and more, until we arrived at our final model.
